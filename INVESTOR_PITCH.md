## The Problem

**Bible Memorization is Boring & Failing**
- Traditional methods feel "churchy" and disconnected from modern life
- Youth retention in churches has dropped 30% over the past decade¹
- Existing Bible apps lack gamification and struggle to retain users beyond 30 days²
- Parents and youth leaders need engaging tools to inspire faith in the digital age
